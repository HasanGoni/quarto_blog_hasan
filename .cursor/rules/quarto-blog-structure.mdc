# Quarto Blog Project Structure

This document outlines the structure and organization of the Quarto blog project.

## Core Configuration Files

- [_quarto.yml](mdc:_quarto.yml): Main configuration file that defines the website structure, navigation, and theme
- [_publish.yml](mdc:_publish.yml): Publishing configuration for the blog
- [styles.css](mdc:styles.css): Custom CSS styles for the website
- [index.qmd](mdc:index.qmd): Homepage of the blog
- [about.qmd](mdc:about.qmd): About page content

## Content Organization

### Blog Posts
All blog posts are stored in the `posts/` directory. Each post is contained in its own directory with the following structure:

```
posts/
├── post-name/
│   ├── index.qmd    # Main post content
│   ├── images/      # Post-specific images
│   └── data/        # Post-specific data files
```

Key post directories:
- Data Science Series:
  - [data-science-steps-to-follow-part01/](mdc:posts/data-science-steps-to-follow-part01)
  - [data-science-steps-to-follow-part02/](mdc:posts/data-science-steps-to-follow-part02)
  - [data-science-steps-to-follow-part03/](mdc:posts/data-science-steps-to-follow-part03)
