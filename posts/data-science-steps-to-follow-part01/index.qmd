# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This guide is based on the excellent course [How to Win a Data Science Competition: Learn from Top Kagglers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/competitive-data-science) by Yandex and MIPT. I've organized these notes to help fellow data scientists master the art of EDA.

## What is EDA?

EDA is the critical first step in any data science project. It helps us:

- Understand the data deeply
- Build intuition about patterns and relationships
- Generate hypotheses for feature engineering
- Find insights that inform modeling decisions

## The Power of Visualization

One of the most powerful EDA tools is visualization. Let's look at a fascinating example from a Kaggle competition:

::: {.callout-tip}
## Real-World Example
In a promotion prediction competition, simple visualization revealed:
- Two key features: promos sent and promos used
- A direct relationship between their difference and the target
- This insight led to 81% accuracy without complex modeling!
:::

```python
# Example visualization code
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_promo_relationship(df):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.scatter('promos_sent', 'promos_used', data=df)
    plt.xlabel('Number of Promos Sent')
    plt.ylabel('Number of Promos Used')
    plt.title('Promo Usage Pattern')
    plt.show()
```

## Building Intuition

### 1. Domain Knowledge Acquisition

Before diving into analysis, focus on:

- Understanding the business goal
- Researching similar problems
- Learning industry-specific metrics
- Reading relevant documentation

### 2. Data Validation

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Validation Checks
- Value ranges (e.g., age between 0-120)
- Logical relationships (clicks â‰¤ impressions)
- Missing value patterns
- Outliers and anomalies
:::

```python
def validate_data(df):
    """Basic data validation checks"""
    issues = []
    
    # Age check
    if df['age'].max() > 120:
        issues.append("Found age > 120")
        
    # Click validation
    if any(df['clicks'] > df['impressions']):
        issues.append("Found clicks > impressions")
    
    return issues
```

### 3. Understanding Data Generation

Key considerations:

- Sampling methodology
- Train/test split rationale
- Time-based patterns
- Data collection process

## Jeremy Howard's Insight
"In data science, there are no outliers - only opportunities to understand your data better."
