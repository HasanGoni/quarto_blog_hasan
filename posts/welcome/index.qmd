## Getting Started

If you're new to data science, I recommend starting with the [Data Science Series Part 1](/posts/data-science-steps-to-follow-part01), where we explore the fundamentals of data analysis.

For those interested in deep learning, check out the [matrix multiplication tutorial](/posts/matrix_multiplication_from_fastai_course) to understand the building blocks of neural networks.
