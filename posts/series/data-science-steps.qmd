## Series Overview

This series follows FastAI's practical, top-down approach to learning data science. Instead of starting with theory, we'll begin with practical applications and gradually dive deeper into the underlying concepts.

### Learning Philosophy

- **Start with the practical**: We begin with working code and real applications
- **Spiral learning**: Revisit concepts multiple times with increasing depth
- **Learn by doing**: Each post includes hands-on notebooks and exercises
