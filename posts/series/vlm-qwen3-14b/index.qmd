## Introduction: What If LLMs Could *Actually* Reason?

As data scientists, we constantly move between raw data and real-world decisions. Whether you're explaining anomalies, generating insights, or deploying models, reasoning is core to our work. But most large language models (LLMs) are still *parrots*—pattern matchers without deeper understanding.

Enter **Qwen3-14B**, Alibaba's newest open-source model. It's not just another massive transformer—it's been designed and instruction-tuned with *reasoning* and *conversation* in mind. And thanks to the amazing open-source work by **Unsloth**, we get a full-featured Colab notebook that lets us try it right now, without needing a GPU cluster.

This post is a walkthrough of that notebook:  
[Colab Notebook: Qwen3 (14B) - Reasoning & Conversational](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/Qwen3_(14B)-Reasoning-Conversational.ipynb)  
We'll unpack each section, explain how things work, and give you hands-on examples to help you integrate Qwen3 into your own workflow.

## Model and Tokenizer Loading

Let's get started by loading the model and tokenizer using HuggingFace Transformers:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
model_id = "unsloth/qwen2-14b-chat-gptq"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map="auto", trust_remote_code=True)
```

## Example: The Reasoning Difference

To see the power of Qwen3, consider this classic chain-of-thought task:

**Prompt:**

Alice has 3 apples. She gives 1 to Bob, then buys 5 more. How many apples does she have?

```python
prompt = "Alice has 3 apples. She gives 1 to Bob, then buys 5 more. How many apples does she have?"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=50)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

**Expected Output:**

Let's break it down.
Alice starts with 3 apples.
She gives 1 to Bob → 3 - 1 = 2.
She buys 5 more → 2 + 5 = 7.
Answer: 7 apples.

## System Prompts and Personality

Qwen3 supports "system prompts" that define tone and behavior:

```python
prompt = "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a sarcastic data science tutor.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhy is my model overfitting?<|im_end|>"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=50)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

**Output:**

Oh, I don't know... maybe because you fed it every single variable and forgot cross-validation? Classic!

## Fine-Tuning and Customization (Optional)

Unsloth supports fine-tuning with LoRA or QLoRA. You could:

- Feed your company's docs and fine-tune a chatbot
- Inject private datasets and business-specific reasoning
- Modify for multi-modal pipelines

_Not covered directly in the notebook—see [the next blog post for a tutorial](finetune-qwen3-14b.qmd)!_

## Performance on Data Science Tasks

Qwen3-14B shines at:

- EDA Explanations
- Math QA
- Prompt Chaining
- Code Review

```python
prompt = "Explain what this code does:\ndf.groupby('region')['sales'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=50)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

**Answer:**

This groups the dataframe df by the 'region' column, computes the mean sales for each group, and sorts the results in descending order.

## TL;DR

If you're a data scientist looking for:

- Open, commercial-friendly LLMs
- Strong reasoning abilities
- Easy deployment via Colab

Qwen3-14B is worth your time.

## Bonus: Prompt Engineering Tips

- **Be Explicit:** Add "Step-by-step reasoning" to prompts.
- **Use System Prompts:** Tailor tone and format.
- **Limit Token Budget:** Keep max tokens reasonable for speed + clarity.

## Why Qwen3-14B?

Before diving into code, here's what makes Qwen3 interesting:

- **Size and Performance:** 14B parameters—big enough to be powerful, small enough to run locally with quantization.
- **Open Weight License:** Truly open, including for commercial use.
- **Reasoning Optimized:** Trained with a focus on multi-step logical tasks, coding, math, and chain-of-thought.

## Setup: Running a 14B Model in Google Colab?

The notebook from Unsloth uses the HuggingFace `transformers` library, `AutoGPTQ`, and 4-bit quantized weights. That means we can run Qwen3-14B on a free Colab GPU (ideally a T4 or A100) without melting our RAM.

```python
!pip install --upgrade --quiet transformers accelerate auto-gptq
```

:::{.callout-important}
- Run the cell above in your Colab notebook before anything else.
- For best results, use a GPU runtime (T4 or A100 preferred).
