## The Story Behind This Series

Imagine you're teaching a robot to see. You show it a picture of your cat, but to the robot, this is just a giant grid of numbers! How do we help it understand what it's looking at? That's the beautiful challenge of computer vision.

This series follows the **Pareto Principle**: we'll focus on the 20% of concepts and tools that give you 80% of the results. By the end, you'll understand the journey from classical OpenCV techniques to modern foundation models like DINOv2.

## Learning Philosophy

Following Jeremy Howard's fastai approach:
- **Start with working code**: See results first, understand theory later
- **Build intuition**: Every concept explained with simple analogies
- **Learn by doing**: Each post includes hands-on Colab notebooks
- **Progressive complexity**: From pixels to neural networks, step by step

## The Journey Ahead

### üéØ **Phase 1: Understanding Images**
1. [**Why Computer Vision?**](cv-foundations/01-why-computer-vision.qmd) - The big picture and motivation
2. [**Images as Data**](cv-foundations/02-images-as-data.qmd) - How computers see the world

### üîß **Phase 2: Classical Computer Vision**
3. [**OpenCV Essentials**](cv-foundations/03-opencv-essentials.qmd) - Your first computer vision toolkit
4. [**Finding Patterns**](cv-foundations/04-finding-patterns.qmd) - Edges, contours, and shapes
5. [**Feature Magic**](cv-foundations/05-feature-magic.qmd) - What makes images unique

### üß† **Phase 3: Deep Learning Revolution**
6. [**Why Deep Learning?**](cv-foundations/06-why-deep-learning.qmd) - When classical methods hit the wall
7. [**Modern Vision Models**](cv-foundations/07-modern-vision-models.qmd) - CNNs, Vision Transformers, and DINOv2

### üöÄ **Phase 4: Building Your Future**
8. [**Your First CV Project**](cv-foundations/08-first-cv-project.qmd) - Putting it all together
9. [**Where to Go Next**](cv-foundations/09-where-to-go-next.qmd) - Your learning roadmap

## What You'll Build

By the end of this series, you'll have:
- **Built 5+ hands-on projects** (from edge detection to object classification)
- **Used both classical and modern techniques** (OpenCV + PyTorch)
- **Extracted features with DINOv2** (foundation model magic)
- **Created your own image classifier** (transfer learning)

## Prerequisites

- **Python basics**: Variables, functions, loops (we'll explain the rest!)
- **Curiosity**: That's honestly the most important part
- **Google account**: For running our Colab notebooks

## Tools We'll Master

- **OpenCV**: The Swiss Army knife of classical computer vision
- **NumPy & Matplotlib**: For working with image data
- **PyTorch**: Modern deep learning framework
- **HuggingFace**: Pre-trained models made easy
- **Google Colab**: Free GPU power for everyone

## How to Use This Series

1. **Read each post** like a story (they're designed to be fun!)
2. **Run the Colab notebooks** (hands-on learning is key)
3. **Experiment with your own images** (use photos of your pets, friends, anything!)
4. **Ask questions** in the comments (no question is too basic)

## A Personal Note

This series is designed for someone just starting their computer vision journey. I believe everyone can learn to teach computers to see ‚Äì it just takes the right approach. We'll go slow, explain everything, and have fun along the way.

Remember: every expert was once a beginner. Let's begin this journey together!
