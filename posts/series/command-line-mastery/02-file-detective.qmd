## The Story: The Million File Challenge

Picture this: You're working with a massive HPC system that contains 2.5 million files spread across thousands of directories. Your supervisor asks you to find all CSV files from a specific experiment that were created last Tuesday. Using a graphical file browser would be like trying to find a specific grain of sand on a beach – theoretically possible, but practically impossible.

This is where you transform from a casual computer user into a digital detective. Today, you'll learn the investigative tools that make Unix systems incredibly powerful for handling massive datasets.

## Your Primary Detective Tool: `find`

The `find` command is like having a super-powered search engine that can locate files based on virtually any criteria. Let's start with the basics:

```bash
find . -name "filename.txt"
```

**What it does**: Searches for files named exactly "filename.txt" starting from the current directory (`.`) and looking in all subdirectories.

**Real-world analogy**: It's like having a detective who can search every room in a massive building, looking for a specific object by name.

### Understanding the `find` Syntax

The basic pattern is:
```bash
find [where_to_search] [search_criteria] [what_to_do]
```

- **Where to search**: `.` (current directory), `~` (home), `/` (entire system)
- **Search criteria**: Name, size, date, type, permissions
- **What to do**: Usually just display the results (default)

## Finding Files by Name

### Exact Name Match
```bash
find . -name "data.csv"
```
Finds files named exactly "data.csv"

### Pattern Matching (Wildcards)
```bash
find . -name "*.csv"           # All CSV files
find . -name "experiment_*"    # Files starting with "experiment_"
find . -name "*2023*"         # Files containing "2023" in the name
```

**Real-world analogy**: Wildcards are like giving a detective a description instead of an exact name. "Find me all files that end with .csv" is like saying "Find me all people wearing red hats."

### Case-Insensitive Search
```bash
find . -iname "*.CSV"    # Finds .csv, .CSV, .Csv, etc.
```

## Finding Files by Type

```bash
find . -type f    # Files only
find . -type d    # Directories only
find . -type l    # Symbolic links only
```

**Real-world analogy**: It's like asking a detective to "find me all the books" vs "find me all the filing cabinets" in a building.

## Finding Files by Size

This is incredibly useful for HPC work where you might need to find large datasets or clean up small temporary files:

```bash
find . -size +100M     # Files larger than 100 MB
find . -size -1k       # Files smaller than 1 KB
find . -size +1G       # Files larger than 1 GB
```

**Size units**:
- `c` = bytes
- `k` = kilobytes  
- `M` = megabytes
- `G` = gigabytes

**Real-world analogy**: It's like asking "Show me all packages heavier than 10 pounds" in a warehouse.

## Finding Files by Date

Critical for HPC work when you need files from specific time periods:

```bash
find . -mtime -7       # Modified in last 7 days
find . -mtime +30      # Modified more than 30 days ago
find . -mtime 1        # Modified exactly 1 day ago
find . -newer file.txt # Modified after file.txt
```

**Time options**:
- `-mtime` = modification time
- `-atime` = access time
- `-ctime` = change time (permissions, ownership)

**Real-world analogy**: It's like asking "Show me all documents that were edited last week" in a massive filing system.

## Combining Search Criteria

Here's where `find` becomes incredibly powerful – you can combine multiple criteria:

```bash
# Find large CSV files modified in the last week
find . -name "*.csv" -size +10M -mtime -7

# Find directories containing "experiment" created in last month
find . -type d -name "*experiment*" -mtime -30

# Find Python files larger than 1MB
find . -name "*.py" -size +1M
```

**Real-world analogy**: It's like giving a detective multiple clues: "Find me all red cars, made by Toyota, from 2020, in the downtown area."

## Practical HPC Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Finding Specific Experiment Data
```bash
# Find all CSV files from experiment_2023 directories
find /data -path "*experiment_2023*" -name "*.csv"

# Find results files from the last 3 days
find /results -name "*.out" -mtime -3
```

### Scenario 2: Cleaning Up Old Files
```bash
# Find temporary files older than 7 days
find /tmp -name "*.tmp" -mtime +7

# Find log files larger than 100MB
find /var/log -name "*.log" -size +100M
```

### Scenario 3: Data Migration Planning
```bash
# Find all files larger than 1GB (need special handling)
find /data -size +1G

# Count files by type
find /data -name "*.csv" | wc -l    # Count CSV files
find /data -name "*.txt" | wc -l    # Count text files
```

## The Speed Demon: `locate`

For frequently used files, there's a faster alternative:

```bash
locate filename.txt
```

**What it does**: Searches a pre-built database of all files on the system.

**Pros**: Lightning fast (searches database, not actual files)
**Cons**: Database might be outdated (usually updated daily)

**Real-world analogy**: It's like using a phone book vs. going door-to-door. The phone book is much faster, but it might have outdated information.

### Updating the locate database
```bash
sudo updatedb    # Updates the database (run as admin)
```

## Advanced Find Techniques

### Execute Commands on Found Files
```bash
# Find and delete old temporary files
find /tmp -name "*.tmp" -mtime +7 -delete

# Find and copy all CSV files to a backup directory
find . -name "*.csv" -exec cp {} /backup/ \;

# Find and show details of large files
find . -size +100M -exec ls -lh {} \;
```

**Real-world analogy**: It's like having a detective who not only finds what you're looking for but also performs actions on each item found.

### Using `find` with Other Commands

```bash
# Find files and count them
find . -name "*.py" | wc -l

# Find files and get total size
find . -name "*.csv" -exec du -ch {} + | tail -1

# Find files and search within them
find . -name "*.txt" -exec grep "error" {} +
```

## Content Detective: `grep`

Sometimes you need to find files based on what's inside them:

```bash
grep "pattern" filename.txt        # Search within a specific file
grep "error" *.log                 # Search in all log files
grep -r "TODO" .                   # Recursively search all files
```

**Real-world analogy**: It's like having a detective who can read through documents and find specific phrases or keywords.

### Useful `grep` Options
```bash
grep -i "pattern" file.txt         # Case-insensitive search
grep -n "pattern" file.txt         # Show line numbers
grep -v "pattern" file.txt         # Show lines that DON'T match
grep -l "pattern" *.txt            # Show only filenames that match
```

## Combining Find and Grep: The Ultimate Detective Combo

```bash
# Find Python files containing "import pandas"
find . -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "import pandas" {} \;

# Find log files with error messages from last week
find /var/log -name "*.log" -mtime -7 -exec grep -l "ERROR" {} \;

# Find configuration files containing specific settings
find /etc -name "*.conf" -exec grep -l "database" {} \;
```

## Real-World HPC Example: The Data Migration Mission

Let's say you need to migrate all experimental data from 2023 that's larger than 100MB:

```bash
# Step 1: Find the files
find /data -path "*2023*" -size +100M -name "*.csv" > large_2023_files.txt

# Step 2: Check how many files and total size
cat large_2023_files.txt | wc -l                    # Count files
find /data -path "*2023*" -size +100M -name "*.csv" -exec du -ch {} + | tail -1  # Total size

# Step 3: Create destination directory
mkdir -p /backup/2023_large_data

# Step 4: Copy the files (we'll learn better methods later)
find /data -path "*2023*" -size +100M -name "*.csv" -exec cp {} /backup/2023_large_data/ \;
```

## Common Detective Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: Searching the Entire System
**Problem**: Running `find / -name "*.txt"` takes forever and searches system files.
**Solution**: Always specify a reasonable starting directory like `find ~/data` or `find /project`.

### Mistake 2: Forgetting Quotes
**Problem**: `find . -name *.txt` might not work as expected.
**Solution**: Always quote patterns: `find . -name "*.txt"`.

### Mistake 3: Case Sensitivity
**Problem**: Looking for "Data.CSV" but files are named "data.csv".
**Solution**: Use `-iname` for case-insensitive searches.

## Performance Tips for Large Systems

1. **Be specific about search locations**: Don't search `/` when you mean `/home/username/data`
2. **Use multiple criteria to narrow results**: Combine name, size, and date filters
3. **Consider `locate` for frequently searched files**: Much faster for simple name searches
4. **Use `find` with `-maxdepth` to limit search depth**: `find . -maxdepth 2 -name "*.csv"`

## Quick Reference: Your Detective Toolkit

| Task | Command | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Find by name | `find . -name "pattern"` | `find . -name "*.csv"` |
| Find by size | `find . -size +100M` | `find . -size +100M` |
| Find by date | `find . -mtime -7` | `find . -mtime -7` |
| Find by type | `find . -type f` | `find . -type f` |
| Fast name search | `locate filename` | `locate data.csv` |
| Search file contents | `grep "pattern" files` | `grep "error" *.log` |
| Recursive content search | `grep -r "pattern" .` | `grep -r "TODO" .` |
