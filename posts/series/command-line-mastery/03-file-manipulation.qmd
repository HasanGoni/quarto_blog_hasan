## The Story: The Digital Architect

Imagine you're an architect, but instead of building with bricks and mortar, you're constructing digital structures with files and directories. You need to create project folders, organize thousands of research files, duplicate important datasets, and sometimes demolish outdated structures to make room for new ones.

With Windows Explorer, this would be like building a skyscraper one brick at a time. But with command line file manipulation, you become a digital wizard who can construct entire file hierarchies, organize massive datasets, and reshape digital landscapes with just a few keystrokes.

Today, you'll learn the magic spells that transform you from a file user into a file master.

## The File Manipulation Toolkit

Just like a craftsperson has different tools for different jobs, you have specialized commands for file operations:

- **`mkdir`**: The architect (creates directories/folders)
- **`touch`**: The creator (creates empty files)
- **`cp`**: The duplicator (copies files and directories)
- **`mv`**: The mover/renamer (moves and renames)
- **`rm`**: The demolisher (removes files and directories)
- **`ln`**: The connector (creates links between files)

**Real-world analogy**: These commands are like having a construction crew where each worker has a specific specialty – one builds frameworks, another moves materials, one makes copies of blueprints, and so on.

## Creating Digital Structures

### Building Directory Hierarchies

```bash
# Create a single directory
mkdir project_2023

# Create multiple directories at once
mkdir data results scripts logs

# Create nested directory structure in one command
mkdir -p experiment_2023/{raw_data,processed_data,analysis/{plots,tables,reports}}
```

**What `-p` does**: Creates parent directories as needed and doesn't complain if directories already exist.

**Real-world analogy**: It's like telling a construction crew "build me a house with these rooms, and if you need to build the foundation first, just do it."

### The Power of Brace Expansion

```bash
# Create organized experiment structure
mkdir -p research_project/{data/{raw,processed,backup},results/{2023,2024},scripts/{python,bash,r}}

# Create monthly directories for a year
mkdir -p reports_2023/{jan,feb,mar,apr,may,jun,jul,aug,sep,oct,nov,dec}

# Create numbered directories
mkdir -p experiment_{01..10}
```

**Real-world analogy**: Brace expansion is like having a smart assistant who understands patterns. You say "create rooms 1 through 10" and they build them all without you having to specify each one.

### Creating Files

```bash
# Create empty files
touch experiment_log.txt analysis_notes.md

# Create multiple files at once
touch data_{01..05}.csv

# Create files with timestamps in names
touch "experiment_$(date +%Y%m%d).log"
```

**Real-world analogy**: `touch` is like having a magic wand that creates empty containers ready to be filled with content.

## The Art of Copying

### Basic Copying Operations

```bash
# Copy a single file
cp source_file.txt destination_file.txt

# Copy file to a directory
cp important_data.csv backup/

# Copy multiple files to a directory
cp *.csv data_backup/
```

### Advanced Copying Techniques

```bash
# Copy entire directory structure
cp -r project_folder project_backup

# Copy with preservation of attributes (timestamps, permissions)
cp -p original_file.txt preserved_copy.txt

# Copy with verbose output (see what's being copied)
cp -v *.txt text_files/

# Interactive copying (ask before overwriting)
cp -i important_file.txt existing_file.txt
```

**Essential cp options**:
- `-r` (recursive): Copy directories and their contents
- `-p` (preserve): Keep original timestamps and permissions
- `-v` (verbose): Show what's being copied
- `-i` (interactive): Ask before overwriting existing files
- `-u` (update): Only copy if source is newer than destination

### Professional Copying Patterns

```bash
# Backup with timestamp
cp -r important_project important_project_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Copy only specific file types
cp *.{csv,txt,log} data_archive/

# Copy files modified in last 7 days
find . -name "*.py" -mtime -7 -exec cp {} recent_scripts/ \;
```

**Real-world analogy**: Advanced copying is like having a professional moving service that can handle delicate items, make inventories, and only move things that actually need moving.

## The Moving and Renaming Dance

### Basic Moving Operations

```bash
# Move (rename) a file
mv old_name.txt new_name.txt

# Move files to a directory
mv *.csv data/

# Move and rename simultaneously
mv messy_filename.txt clean_experiment_data.csv
```

### Batch Renaming Strategies

```bash
# Rename files with a pattern
for file in *.txt; do
    mv "$file" "${file%.txt}_processed.txt"
done

# Add prefix to all files
for file in *.csv; do
    mv "$file" "experiment_$file"
done

# Change file extensions
for file in *.dat; do
    mv "$file" "${file%.dat}.csv"
done
```

**Real-world analogy**: Batch renaming is like having a labeling machine that can systematically relabel hundreds of items according to your specifications.

### Organizing Files by Date

```bash
# Move files to directories based on modification date
for file in *.log; do
    year=$(date -r "$file" +%Y)
    month=$(date -r "$file" +%m)
    mkdir -p "logs/$year/$month"
    mv "$file" "logs/$year/$month/"
done
```

## Safe Destruction: The `rm` Command

### Basic Removal

```bash
# Remove a single file
rm unwanted_file.txt

# Remove multiple files
rm *.tmp temp_*.log

# Remove empty directory
rmdir empty_folder

# Remove directory and all contents
rm -r old_project_folder
```

### Safety First: Protective Removal

```bash
# Interactive removal (ask for each file)
rm -i *.txt

# Verbose removal (show what's being deleted)
rm -v temporary_files/*

# The safest approach: move to trash instead
mkdir -p ~/.trash
mv unwanted_files/* ~/.trash/
```

**Critical safety tip**: There's no "recycle bin" in Unix! Once you `rm` something, it's gone forever. Always double-check your commands.

**Real-world analogy**: Using `rm` is like using a paper shredder – once you feed something in, there's no getting it back. Always be sure!

## Advanced File Operations

### Creating Symbolic Links

```bash
# Create a symbolic link (shortcut)
ln -s /long/path/to/important/data data_link

# Create links to frequently used directories
ln -s /scratch/username/current_project current
ln -s /home/username/scripts/analysis.py analyze
```

**Real-world analogy**: Symbolic links are like having multiple doorways into the same room. You can access the same content from different locations.

### File Permissions and Ownership

```bash
# Make a file executable
chmod +x my_script.sh

# Set specific permissions
chmod 755 public_script.sh    # rwxr-xr-x
chmod 644 data_file.csv       # rw-r--r--

# Change ownership (if you have permission)
chown username:groupname important_file.txt
```

## Real-World HPC Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Organizing Experimental Data

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# organize_experiment.sh - Organize messy experimental data

# Create organized structure
mkdir -p experiment_2023/{raw_data,processed_data,analysis,results,scripts,logs}

# Move files by type
mv *.csv experiment_2023/raw_data/
mv *.py experiment_2023/scripts/
mv *.log experiment_2023/logs/
mv *.txt experiment_2023/analysis/

# Create backup
cp -r experiment_2023 experiment_2023_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)

echo "Experiment data organized successfully!"
```

### Scenario 2: Batch Processing Setup

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# setup_batch_processing.sh - Prepare files for parallel processing

INPUT_DIR="raw_data"
OUTPUT_DIR="processing_jobs"

# Create job directories
mkdir -p $OUTPUT_DIR

# Split large dataset into smaller chunks for parallel processing
split_size=1000  # lines per file

for large_file in $INPUT_DIR/*.csv; do
    filename=$(basename "$large_file" .csv)
    
    # Split file into chunks
    split -l $split_size "$large_file" "$OUTPUT_DIR/${filename}_chunk_"
    
    # Rename chunks with proper extension
    for chunk in "$OUTPUT_DIR/${filename}_chunk_"*; do
        mv "$chunk" "${chunk}.csv"
    done
    
    echo "Split $large_file into chunks"
done
```

### Scenario 3: Results Consolidation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# consolidate_results.sh - Gather results from parallel jobs

RESULTS_DIR="job_results"
FINAL_DIR="consolidated_results"

mkdir -p $FINAL_DIR

# Consolidate CSV results
cat $RESULTS_DIR/*.csv > $FINAL_DIR/all_results.csv

# Organize by experiment type
for result_file in $RESULTS_DIR/*.out; do
    experiment_type=$(grep "Experiment:" "$result_file" | cut -d: -f2 | tr -d ' ')
    mkdir -p "$FINAL_DIR/$experiment_type"
    cp "$result_file" "$FINAL_DIR/$experiment_type/"
done

# Create summary
echo "Results consolidated on $(date)" > $FINAL_DIR/consolidation_summary.txt
echo "Total result files: $(ls $RESULTS_DIR/*.out | wc -l)" >> $FINAL_DIR/consolidation_summary.txt
```

## Pro Tips for Efficient File Manipulation

### 1. Use Wildcards Effectively

```bash
# Select files by pattern
cp experiment_*.csv backup/          # Files starting with "experiment_"
mv *_temp.* temp_files/             # Files ending with "_temp"
rm *.{tmp,log,bak}                  # Multiple extensions

# More complex patterns
cp [0-9][0-9][0-9]_data.csv archive/    # Three-digit numbers
mv *[!0-9].txt text_files/              # Files NOT ending with numbers
```

### 2. Combine Commands for Power

```bash
# Find and copy files modified today
find . -name "*.py" -mtime -1 -exec cp {} today_scripts/ \;

# Move large files to archive
find . -size +100M -exec mv {} archive/ \;

# Copy files but skip existing ones
cp -n source/* destination/    # -n = no-clobber (don't overwrite)
```

### 3. Use Command Substitution

```bash
# Copy files to date-based directories
cp important_files/* backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)/

# Move files based on their content
for file in *.txt; do
    if grep -q "experiment_1" "$file"; then
        mv "$file" experiment_1_results/
    fi
done
```

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Destructive Operations Without Backup

**Problem**: Running `rm -rf` or `mv` commands that destroy data
**Solution**: Always backup first, use `-i` flag for interactive mode

```bash
# BAD: Dangerous removal
rm -rf important_directory/

# GOOD: Safe approach
cp -r important_directory important_directory_backup
rm -ri important_directory/    # Interactive removal
```

### Mistake 2: Not Handling Spaces in Filenames

**Problem**: Commands fail with filenames containing spaces
**Solution**: Always quote variables and filenames

```bash
# BAD: Fails with spaces
cp $filename destination/

# GOOD: Handles spaces
cp "$filename" destination/
```

### Mistake 3: Overwriting Important Files

**Problem**: Accidentally overwriting existing files
**Solution**: Use `-i` (interactive) or `-n` (no-clobber) flags

```bash
# GOOD: Ask before overwriting
cp -i source.txt destination.txt

# GOOD: Never overwrite existing files
cp -n source.txt destination.txt
```

## Practice Exercises

:::{.callout-important}
## Your File Manipulation Training

1. **Create a project structure**
   ```bash
   # Create this structure:
   # my_project/
   # ├── data/
   # │   ├── raw/
   # │   └── processed/
   # ├── scripts/
   # ├── results/
   # └── docs/
   ```

2. **Practice safe file operations**
   ```bash
   # Create some test files, copy them, rename them, and organize them
   touch test_{1..5}.txt
   # Now organize these files into appropriate directories
   ```

3. **Batch rename exercise**
   ```bash
   # Create files with messy names and clean them up
   touch "messy file name.txt" "another-bad_name.txt" "UPPERCASE.TXT"
   # Rename them to follow a consistent naming convention
   ```

4. **Backup and cleanup**
   ```bash
   # Create a backup strategy for important files
   # Then safely remove temporary files
   ```
