## The Story: The Digital Archaeologist

Imagine you're an archaeologist, but instead of digging through ancient ruins, you're excavating insights from massive text files containing millions of lines of research data. Your tools aren't brushes and trowels – they're powerful text processing commands that can sift through gigabytes of data in seconds, finding patterns, extracting specific information, and transforming raw data into meaningful insights.

With Windows Notepad or Excel, analyzing large text files would be like excavating a pyramid with a teaspoon. But with Unix text processing tools, you become a digital archaeologist with laser scanners and precision instruments, capable of extracting exactly what you need from the vast digital landscape.

Today, you'll master the ancient arts of text manipulation that turn you from a data observer into a data wizard.

## The Text Processing Arsenal

Your text processing toolkit contains specialized instruments, each designed for specific tasks:

- **`cat`**: The reader (displays file contents)
- **`head/tail`**: The samplers (show beginning/end of files)
- **`grep`**: The hunter (searches for patterns)
- **`sort`**: The organizer (arranges data in order)
- **`uniq`**: The deduplicator (removes duplicates)
- **`cut`**: The column extractor (selects specific fields)
- **`awk`**: The data sculptor (processes structured text)
- **`sed`**: The transformer (edits text streams)
- **`wc`**: The counter (counts lines, words, characters)

**Real-world analogy**: These tools are like having a complete laboratory where each instrument has a specific purpose – microscopes for detailed inspection, filters for separation, scales for measurement, and computers for complex analysis.

## Basic Text Inspection

### Looking at File Contents

```bash
# Display entire file (careful with large files!)
cat data.txt

# Display file with line numbers
cat -n experiment_log.txt

# Display first 10 lines
head data.csv

# Display first 20 lines
head -n 20 data.csv

# Display last 10 lines
tail results.log

# Follow a growing file (like watching a log in real-time)
tail -f experiment.log
```

**Real-world analogy**: These commands are like different ways of reading a book – sometimes you want to read the whole thing, sometimes just the first chapter, sometimes just the conclusion, and sometimes you want to watch as new pages are being written.

### Quick File Statistics

```bash
# Count lines, words, and characters
wc data.txt

# Count only lines
wc -l *.csv

# Count files in directory
ls *.txt | wc -l

# Get file size in human-readable format
du -h large_dataset.csv
```

## The Pattern Hunter: `grep`

`grep` is your digital bloodhound, capable of sniffing out specific patterns in massive files.

### Basic Pattern Searching

```bash
# Find lines containing "error"
grep "error" log_file.txt

# Case-insensitive search
grep -i "ERROR" log_file.txt

# Search in multiple files
grep "experiment_1" *.txt

# Show line numbers
grep -n "important" data.txt

# Show lines that DON'T match
grep -v "comment" data.csv
```

### Advanced Pattern Hunting

```bash
# Count matching lines
grep -c "success" results.log

# Show only filenames that contain pattern
grep -l "error" *.log

# Show context around matches
grep -A 3 -B 3 "error" log.txt    # 3 lines after and before

# Search recursively in directories
grep -r "TODO" project_files/

# Use regular expressions
grep "^[0-9]" data.txt           # Lines starting with numbers
grep "[0-9]$" data.txt           # Lines ending with numbers
```

**Real-world analogy**: Advanced grep is like having a detective who can not only find what you're looking for but also show you the surrounding evidence and tell you exactly where and how many times they found it.

## The Data Organizer: `sort`

Sorting is fundamental to data analysis – it reveals patterns and makes data searchable.

### Basic Sorting

```bash
# Sort lines alphabetically
sort names.txt

# Sort in reverse order
sort -r scores.txt

# Sort numerically (not alphabetically)
sort -n numbers.txt

# Sort by specific column (space-separated)
sort -k 2 data.txt               # Sort by second column

# Sort CSV by specific column
sort -t ',' -k 3 data.csv        # Sort by third column, comma-separated
```

### Advanced Sorting Strategies

```bash
# Sort by multiple columns
sort -k 1,1 -k 2,2n data.txt     # First by column 1 (text), then by column 2 (numeric)

# Sort by file size
ls -l | sort -k 5 -n             # Sort files by size

# Sort unique values
sort data.txt | uniq

# Sort and count occurrences
sort data.txt | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

**Real-world analogy**: Sorting is like organizing a library – you can arrange books by title, author, publication date, or size, making it easy to find what you need and spot patterns.

## The Column Surgeon: `cut`

`cut` extracts specific columns from structured text, like a precision scalpel for data.

### Basic Column Extraction

```bash
# Extract first column (space-separated)
cut -d ' ' -f 1 data.txt

# Extract multiple columns
cut -d ',' -f 1,3,5 data.csv      # Columns 1, 3, and 5 from CSV

# Extract character ranges
cut -c 1-10 fixed_width.txt       # Characters 1-10 from each line

# Extract from specific character to end
cut -c 15- data.txt               # From character 15 to end of line
```

### Real-World Data Extraction

```bash
# Extract usernames from system log
cut -d ':' -f 1 /etc/passwd

# Get just the filenames from ls -l output
ls -l | cut -d ' ' -f 9

# Extract specific fields from CSV
cut -d ',' -f 2,4 experiment_data.csv > selected_columns.csv
```

## The Duplicate Detective: `uniq`

`uniq` finds and manages duplicate lines in your data.

```bash
# Remove consecutive duplicate lines
uniq data.txt

# Count occurrences of each unique line
uniq -c data.txt

# Show only duplicate lines
uniq -d data.txt

# Show only unique lines (no duplicates)
uniq -u data.txt

# Case-insensitive uniqueness
uniq -i data.txt
```

**Important**: `uniq` only works on consecutive duplicate lines, so usually you need to sort first:

```bash
# Proper way to find all unique values
sort data.txt | uniq

# Count all occurrences
sort data.txt | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

## The Data Sculptor: `awk`

`awk` is like having a programmable data processing workshop. It can perform complex operations on structured text.

### Basic AWK Operations

```bash
# Print specific columns
awk '{print $1, $3}' data.txt    # Print columns 1 and 3

# Print with custom formatting
awk '{print "Name:", $1, "Score:", $2}' scores.txt

# Process CSV files
awk -F ',' '{print $1, $3}' data.csv

# Add line numbers
awk '{print NR, $0}' data.txt
```

### AWK Power Features

```bash
# Conditional processing
awk '$2 > 100 {print $1, $2}' scores.txt    # Print if second column > 100

# Calculate sums
awk '{sum += $2} END {print "Total:", sum}' numbers.txt

# Count occurrences
awk '{count[$1]++} END {for (i in count) print i, count[i]}' data.txt

# Process specific lines
awk 'NR > 1 {print}' data.csv    # Skip header line
```

**Real-world analogy**: AWK is like having a Swiss Army knife that can cut, measure, calculate, and transform your data all in one tool.

## The Text Transformer: `sed`

`sed` (stream editor) modifies text as it flows through, like having a assembly line that transforms your data.

### Basic Text Substitution

```bash
# Replace first occurrence per line
sed 's/old/new/' data.txt

# Replace all occurrences
sed 's/old/new/g' data.txt

# Replace and save to new file
sed 's/old/new/g' input.txt > output.txt

# Replace in-place (modify original file)
sed -i 's/old/new/g' data.txt
```

### Advanced Text Transformation

```bash
# Delete lines containing pattern
sed '/pattern/d' data.txt

# Delete empty lines
sed '/^$/d' data.txt

# Insert text before/after pattern
sed '/pattern/i\New line before' data.txt
sed '/pattern/a\New line after' data.txt

# Extract lines between patterns
sed -n '/START/,/END/p' data.txt
```

## Real-World HPC Text Processing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Log File Analysis

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# analyze_experiment_logs.sh - Extract insights from experiment logs

LOG_FILE="experiment.log"
REPORT_FILE="log_analysis_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt"

echo "Experiment Log Analysis - $(date)" > $REPORT_FILE
echo "=================================" >> $REPORT_FILE

# Count total entries
echo "Total log entries: $(wc -l < $LOG_FILE)" >> $REPORT_FILE

# Count errors and warnings
echo "Errors: $(grep -c "ERROR" $LOG_FILE)" >> $REPORT_FILE
echo "Warnings: $(grep -c "WARNING" $LOG_FILE)" >> $REPORT_FILE

# Most common error types
echo -e "\nTop Error Types:" >> $REPORT_FILE
grep "ERROR" $LOG_FILE | cut -d ':' -f 3 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -5 >> $REPORT_FILE

# Processing times analysis
echo -e "\nProcessing Times (seconds):" >> $REPORT_FILE
grep "Processing time" $LOG_FILE | awk '{print $4}' | sort -n | awk '
{
    sum += $1
    count++
    values[count] = $1
}
END {
    print "Average:", sum/count
    print "Minimum:", values[1]
    print "Maximum:", values[count]
    print "Median:", values[int(count/2)]
}' >> $REPORT_FILE

echo "Analysis complete. Report saved to $REPORT_FILE"
```

### Scenario 2: CSV Data Processing

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# process_experimental_data.sh - Clean and analyze CSV data

INPUT_FILE="raw_experiment_data.csv"
CLEAN_FILE="clean_data.csv"
SUMMARY_FILE="data_summary.txt"

# Remove header for processing, then add it back
head -n 1 $INPUT_FILE > $CLEAN_FILE

# Clean data: remove empty lines, sort by timestamp
tail -n +2 $INPUT_FILE | \
    grep -v '^$' | \
    sort -t ',' -k 1 >> $CLEAN_FILE

# Generate summary statistics
echo "Data Summary for $(basename $INPUT_FILE)" > $SUMMARY_FILE
echo "Generated: $(date)" >> $SUMMARY_FILE
echo "=================================" >> $SUMMARY_FILE

# Count records
echo "Total records: $(tail -n +2 $CLEAN_FILE | wc -l)" >> $SUMMARY_FILE

# Unique subjects
echo "Unique subjects: $(cut -d ',' -f 2 $CLEAN_FILE | tail -n +2 | sort | uniq | wc -l)" >> $SUMMARY_FILE

# Date range
echo "Date range:" >> $SUMMARY_FILE
echo "  From: $(cut -d ',' -f 1 $CLEAN_FILE | tail -n +2 | head -n 1)" >> $SUMMARY_FILE
echo "  To:   $(cut -d ',' -f 1 $CLEAN_FILE | tail -n +2 | tail -n 1)" >> $SUMMARY_FILE

# Value statistics (assuming numeric data in column 3)
echo -e "\nValue Statistics:" >> $SUMMARY_FILE
cut -d ',' -f 3 $CLEAN_FILE | tail -n +2 | sort -n | awk '
{
    sum += $1
    count++
    values[count] = $1
}
END {
    print "Count:", count
    print "Sum:", sum
    print "Average:", sum/count
    print "Min:", values[1]
    print "Max:", values[count]
}' >> $SUMMARY_FILE

echo "Data processing complete!"
echo "Clean data: $CLEAN_FILE"
echo "Summary: $SUMMARY_FILE"
```

### Scenario 3: Results Aggregation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# aggregate_results.sh - Combine and summarize multiple result files

RESULTS_DIR="job_results"
OUTPUT_FILE="aggregated_results.csv"
SUMMARY_FILE="results_summary.txt"

# Create header
echo "job_id,parameter,result,processing_time" > $OUTPUT_FILE

# Process all result files
for result_file in $RESULTS_DIR/*.out; do
    if [ -f "$result_file" ]; then
        job_id=$(basename "$result_file" .out)
        
        # Extract key information using different tools
        parameter=$(grep "Parameter:" "$result_file" | cut -d ':' -f 2 | tr -d ' ')
        result=$(grep "Final result:" "$result_file" | awk '{print $3}')
        time=$(grep "Processing time:" "$result_file" | awk '{print $3}')
        
        # Add to aggregated file
        echo "$job_id,$parameter,$result,$time" >> $OUTPUT_FILE
    fi
done

# Generate summary
echo "Results Aggregation Summary" > $SUMMARY_FILE
echo "Generated: $(date)" >> $SUMMARY_FILE
echo "===========================" >> $SUMMARY_FILE

total_jobs=$(tail -n +2 $OUTPUT_FILE | wc -l)
echo "Total jobs processed: $total_jobs" >> $SUMMARY_FILE

# Parameter distribution
echo -e "\nParameter Distribution:" >> $SUMMARY_FILE
cut -d ',' -f 2 $OUTPUT_FILE | tail -n +2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr >> $SUMMARY_FILE

# Result statistics
echo -e "\nResult Statistics:" >> $SUMMARY_FILE
cut -d ',' -f 3 $OUTPUT_FILE | tail -n +2 | sort -n | awk '
{
    sum += $1
    count++
    values[count] = $1
}
END {
    print "Count:", count
    print "Average:", sum/count
    print "Min:", values[1]
    print "Max:", values[count]
    print "Std Dev: (calculated separately)"
}' >> $SUMMARY_FILE

echo "Aggregation complete!"
echo "Results file: $OUTPUT_FILE"
echo "Summary: $SUMMARY_FILE"
```

## Power Combinations: Pipes and Chains

The real magic happens when you combine tools using pipes (`|`):

```bash
# Find most common words in a file
cat text_file.txt | tr ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10

# Analyze web server logs
cat access.log | grep "404" | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# Process CSV data
cat data.csv | cut -d ',' -f 2,4 | grep -v "^$" | sort | uniq -c

# Monitor system processes
ps aux | grep python | awk '{print $2, $11}' | sort

# Analyze file sizes by extension
find . -name "*.*" | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

**Real-world analogy**: Pipes are like assembly lines in a factory – each station performs one specific operation, and the product moves smoothly from one stage to the next until you get the final result.

## Performance Tips for Large Files

### Efficient Processing Strategies

```bash
# For very large files, use head/tail to sample first
head -n 1000 huge_file.txt | grep "pattern"

# Use grep before other operations to reduce data size
grep "relevant_pattern" large_file.txt | sort | uniq -c

# Process files in chunks
split -l 10000 huge_file.txt chunk_
for chunk in chunk_*; do
    process_chunk "$chunk"
done

# Use specific tools for specific tasks
# grep is faster than awk for simple pattern matching
# cut is faster than awk for simple column extraction
```
