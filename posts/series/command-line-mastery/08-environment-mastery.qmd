## The Story: The Digital Laboratory Designer

Imagine you're setting up the perfect research laboratory. You want your most-used tools within arm's reach, your workspace organized exactly how you think, and your environment configured to automatically adapt to different types of experiments. Some days you're doing data analysis, other days you're running simulations, and sometimes you're collaborating with teams using different software stacks.

In the physical world, this would require multiple specialized labs. But in the Unix command line, you can create a single, infinitely adaptable workspace that transforms itself based on your needs. Your shell environment is like having a smart laboratory that remembers your preferences, loads the right tools automatically, and even adapts its behavior based on what you're working on.

Today, you'll become a master laboratory designer, creating a personalized command line environment that works exactly the way you think.

## Understanding Your Shell Environment

Your shell environment is like the atmosphere of your digital workspace – it contains all the settings, variables, and configurations that determine how your commands behave.

### The Environment Ecosystem

```bash
# See all environment variables
env

# See shell variables (includes environment variables)
set

# See specific variable
echo $HOME
echo $PATH
echo $USER
```

**Real-world analogy**: Environment variables are like the settings on all the equipment in your lab – the temperature, pressure, lighting, and tool configurations that everything else depends on.

### Key Environment Variables

```bash
# Essential environment variables
echo $HOME        # Your home directory
echo $USER        # Your username
echo $PATH        # Where the shell looks for commands
echo $SHELL       # Your current shell
echo $PWD         # Current working directory
echo $OLDPWD      # Previous working directory
echo $LANG        # Language and locale settings
echo $TERM        # Terminal type
```

## The PATH: Your Command Highway System

The `PATH` variable is like a highway system that tells your shell where to find commands.

### Understanding PATH

```bash
# View your current PATH
echo $PATH

# PATH is a colon-separated list of directories
# /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

# See which version of a command will run
which python
which gcc
which ls

# See all versions of a command in PATH
whereis python
```

### Modifying PATH

```bash
# Add directory to beginning of PATH (highest priority)
export PATH="/new/directory:$PATH"

# Add directory to end of PATH (lowest priority)
export PATH="$PATH:/another/directory"

# Add multiple directories
export PATH="/opt/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

# Temporarily modify PATH for one command
PATH="/special/path:$PATH" special_command
```

## Shell Configuration Files

Your shell reads configuration files when it starts, like a laboratory that runs a checklist every time you enter.

### The Configuration File Hierarchy

```bash
# System-wide configuration (affects all users)
/etc/profile
/etc/bash.bashrc

# User-specific configuration (in your home directory)
~/.bash_profile    # Login shells
~/.bashrc          # Interactive shells
~/.bash_logout     # When you log out
~/.profile         # POSIX-compliant (works with any shell)
```

### Sample .bashrc Configuration

```bash
# ~/.bashrc - Your personal shell configuration

# Source global definitions
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
    . /etc/bashrc
fi

# ===============================
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# ===============================

# Set default editor
export EDITOR=nano
export VISUAL=nano

# Set PATH additions
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Research-specific environment
export RESEARCH_DATA="$HOME/research/data"
export SCRATCH_DIR="/scratch/$USER"
export PROJECT_ROOT="$HOME/projects/current"

# ===============================
# ALIASES
# ===============================

# Safety aliases
alias rm='rm -i'
alias cp='cp -i'
alias mv='mv -i'

# Convenience aliases
alias ll='ls -alF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias ..='cd ..'
alias ...='cd ../..'

# Directory shortcuts
alias home='cd ~'
alias data='cd $RESEARCH_DATA'
alias scratch='cd $SCRATCH_DIR'
alias project='cd $PROJECT_ROOT'

# Development aliases
alias py='python'
alias py3='python3'
alias ipy='ipython'

# Git aliases
alias gs='git status'
alias ga='git add'
alias gc='git commit'

# ===============================
# FUNCTIONS
# ===============================

# Quick directory creation and navigation
mkcd() {
    mkdir -p "$1" && cd "$1"
}

# Find files by name
ff() {
    find . -name "*$1*" -type f
}

# Extract various archive formats
extract() {
    if [ -f "$1" ]; then
        case "$1" in
            *.tar.bz2)   tar xjf "$1"     ;;
            *.tar.gz)    tar xzf "$1"     ;;
            *.zip)       unzip "$1"       ;;
            *)           echo "Cannot extract '$1'" ;;
        esac
    fi
}

# ===============================
# PROMPT CUSTOMIZATION
# ===============================

# Colors for prompt
RED='\[\033[0;31m\]'
GREEN='\[\033[0;32m\]'
BLUE='\[\033[0;34m\]'
RESET='\[\033[0m\]'

# Custom prompt
PS1="${GREEN}\u@\h${RESET}:${BLUE}\w${RESET}\$ "
```

## Advanced Environment Management

### Project-Specific Environments

```bash
# Project-specific environment setup
setup_project() {
    local project_name="$1"
    local project_dir="$HOME/projects/$project_name"
    
    if [ -d "$project_dir" ]; then
        export PROJECT_NAME="$project_name"
        export PROJECT_ROOT="$project_dir"
        export PROJECT_DATA="$project_dir/data"
        export PROJECT_SCRIPTS="$project_dir/scripts"
        
        # Add project scripts to PATH
        export PATH="$PROJECT_SCRIPTS:$PATH"
        
        cd "$project_dir"
        echo "Environment set up for project: $project_name"
    fi
}
```

### Module System Integration

```bash
# Function to load standard research environment
load_research_env() {
    module purge
    module load gcc/9.3.0
    module load python/3.9.2
    module load R/4.1.0
    echo "Research environment loaded"
}

# Aliases for quick environment switching
alias resenv='load_research_env'
```

## Quick Reference: Environment Management

| Task | Command | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| View environment | `env` | `env \| grep PATH` |
| Set variable | `export VAR=value` | `export EDITOR=nano` |
| View variable | `echo $VAR` | `echo $HOME` |
| Add to PATH | `export PATH="dir:$PATH"` | `export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"` |
| Edit .bashrc | `nano ~/.bashrc` | `nano ~/.bashrc` |
| Reload config | `source ~/.bashrc` | `source ~/.bashrc` |
| Create alias | `alias name='command'` | `alias ll='ls -la'` |
