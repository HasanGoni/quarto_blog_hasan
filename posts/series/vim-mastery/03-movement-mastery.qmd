## The Speed of Thought

Imagine you're reading a book, and every time you want to look at a different paragraph, you have to slowly drag your finger across each word. That's what using arrow keys feels like to a Vim master!

Vim movement is like teleportation - you think about where you want to go, and you're there. Today, we'll learn to move through text at the speed of thought.

## The Movement Mindset

**Traditional editors**: Move character by character, line by line
**Vim**: Move by meaning - words, sentences, paragraphs, functions

**Traditional**: "I need to go 15 characters to the right"
**Vim**: "I need to go to the next function"

This mindset shift transforms how you think about text navigation.

## The Essential Movement Commands

### Basic Movements: Your Foundation 🏃‍♂️

These replace your arrow keys:

| Command | Movement | Think |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `h` | Left | "**h**and points left" |
| `j` | Down | "**j**umps down" |
| `k` | Up | "**k**icks up" |
| `l` | Right | "**l**ooks right" |

**Memory trick**: `j` looks like a down arrow, `k` is above `j` so it goes up!

### Word Movements: Think in Words 📝

| Command | Movement | Story |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `w` | Next word start | "**w**ord forward" |
| `b` | Previous word start | "**b**ack a word" |
| `e` | Next word end | "**e**nd of word" |
| `ge` | Previous word end | "**g**o to **e**nd backward" |

### Line Movements: Master Your Lines 📏

| Command | Movement | Story |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `0` | Start of line | "**0** is the beginning" |
| `^` | First non-blank character | "**^** points to first real character" |
| `$` | End of line | "**$** is the end in regex" |
| `g_` | Last non-blank character | "**g**o to last real character" |

### Screen Movements: See the Big Picture 🖥️

| Command | Movement | Story |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `H` | Top of screen | "**H**igh on screen" |
| `M` | Middle of screen | "**M**iddle of screen" |
| `L` | Bottom of screen | "**L**ow on screen" |
| `gg` | Top of file | "**g**o to beginning" |
| `G` | Bottom of file | "**G**o to end" |

## Practical Examples: Movement in Action

### Example 1: Fixing a Function Name

**Scenario**: You need to change `calculateTotal` to `computeSum` in this line:
```python
def calculateTotal(items):
```

**Inefficient way**: Arrow keys to navigate
**Vim way**:
1. `^` - Jump to start of line
2. `w` - Move to "calculateTotal"
3. `cw` - Change word
4. Type "computeSum"

### Example 2: Jumping to a Specific Line

**Scenario**: Error on line 47

**Inefficient way**: Scroll and count
**Vim way**:
1. `:47` - Jump directly to line 47
2. Or `47G` - Same result

### Example 3: Moving Through a Function

**Scenario**: Navigate through this function:
```python
def process_data(data):
    # Clean the data
    cleaned = clean_data(data)
    
    # Transform it
    transformed = transform_data(cleaned)
    
    # Return result
    return transformed
```

**Vim way**:
- `}` - Jump to next paragraph (empty line)
- `{` - Jump to previous paragraph
- `w` - Move word by word through code
- `$` - Jump to end of current line

## Advanced Movement: The Power Moves 🚀

### Search-Based Movement

| Command | Movement | Story |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `/pattern` | Search forward | "**/** means search" |
| `?pattern` | Search backward | "**?** questions search backward" |
| `n` | Next match | "**n**ext result" |
| `N` | Previous match | "**N**ext backward" |
| `*` | Search word under cursor | "***** highlights current word" |
| `#` | Search word backward | "**#** searches backward" |

### Character-Based Movement

| Command | Movement | Story |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `f{char}` | Find character forward | "**f**ind character" |
| `F{char}` | Find character backward | "**F**ind backward" |
| `t{char}` | Till character forward | "**t**ill character" |
| `T{char}` | Till character backward | "**T**ill backward" |
| `;` | Repeat last f/t | "**;** continues search" |
| `,` | Repeat last f/t backward | "**,** goes back" |

### Bracket and Brace Movement

| Command | Movement | Story |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `%` | Match bracket/brace | "**%** matches pairs" |
| `[{` | Previous opening brace | "**[** opens backward" |
| `]}` | Next closing brace | "**]** closes forward" |

## Movement Combinations: The Magic Multiplier ✨

You can combine numbers with movements:

| Command | Movement | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `3w` | Move 3 words forward | Jump over 3 words |
| `5j` | Move 5 lines down | Skip 5 lines |
| `2f.` | Find 2nd period | Jump to second dot |
| `4$` | Move to end of 4th line down | Jump to end of 4th line |

## Practice Exercise: Movement Mastery

Create a file with this content:
```python
def calculate_total(items):
    """Calculate the total price of items."""
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        if item.price > 0:
            total += item.price
        else:
            print(f"Warning: {item.name} has invalid price")
    return total

def process_order(order):
    """Process a customer order."""
    items = order.items
    total = calculate_total(items)
    return {"total": total, "status": "processed"}
```

**Practice these movements**:
1. `gg` - Go to top
2. `f(` - Find first parenthesis
3. `w` - Move to next word
4. `$` - End of line
5. `j` - Down one line
6. `^` - Start of line
7. `/total` - Search for "total"
8. `n` - Next occurrence
9. `G` - Go to bottom
10. `%` - Match the closing brace

## The Efficiency Mindset

### Instead of This...
- Arrow keys: ↓↓↓→→→→→→→→
- Mouse: Click and drag
- Page Up/Down: Scroll and search

### Think Like This...
- "I want the next function" → `}` 
- "I want that word" → `w` or `/word`
- "I want line 25" → `:25`
- "I want the matching brace" → `%`

## Common Movement Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using Arrow Keys
**Problem**: Slow and inefficient
**Solution**: Force yourself to use `hjkl` for a week

### Mistake 2: Not Using Word Movements
**Problem**: Moving character by character
**Solution**: Think in words, use `w`, `b`, `e`

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Search
**Problem**: Scrolling to find text
**Solution**: Use `/` to search, `n` to repeat

### Mistake 4: Forgetting Line Jumps
**Problem**: Scrolling to specific lines
**Solution**: Use `:number` or `numberG`

## Building Movement Muscle Memory

### Week 1: Basic Movements
- Replace arrow keys with `hjkl`
- Use `w` and `b` for word movement
- Practice `0` and `$` for line navigation

### Week 2: Screen and File Navigation
- Use `gg` and `G` for file navigation
- Practice `H`, `M`, `L` for screen movement
- Start using `{}` for paragraph jumping

### Week 3: Advanced Navigation
- Master `f` and `t` for character finding
- Use `/` and `?` for searching
- Practice `%` for bracket matching

### Week 4: Combination Mastery
- Combine numbers with movements (`3w`, `5j`)
- Use search with navigation (`/function` then `n`)
- Practice complex movements in real code

## Speed Benchmarks

Track your progress:

**Beginner**: Moving to a word takes 5+ keystrokes
**Intermediate**: Moving to a word takes 2-3 keystrokes
**Advanced**: Moving to a word takes 1-2 keystrokes
**Expert**: You think of a location and you're there

## What's Next?

You now know:
- Basic movement commands (`hjkl`, `w`, `b`, `e`)
- Line navigation (`0`, `^`, `$`)
- File navigation (`gg`, `G`, `H`, `M`, `L`)
- Search-based movement (`/`, `?`, `n`, `N`)
- Character finding (`f`, `t`, `;`, `,`)
- Movement combinations (numbers + movements)

In the next post, we'll learn about [Text Objects: The Secret Weapon](04-text-objects.qmd) and discover how to select exactly what you want to edit.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Think in meaning, not characters** - move by words, not letters
2. **Use search for distant targets** - `/` is faster than scrolling
3. **Combine numbers with movements** - `3w` is better than `www`
4. **Practice daily** - muscle memory is everything
5. **Don't use arrow keys** - force yourself to use `hjkl`

Movement is the foundation of Vim mastery. Once you can navigate at the speed of thought, everything else becomes natural.
