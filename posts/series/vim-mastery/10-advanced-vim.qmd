```

## Vim Scripting and Customization

### Custom Key Mappings
```vim
" Custom mappings in .vimrc
nnoremap <leader>w :w<CR>
nnoremap <leader>q :q<CR>
nnoremap <leader>f :FZF<CR>
nnoremap <leader>t :NERDTreeToggle<CR>

" Function keys
nnoremap <F2> :set number!<CR>
nnoremap <F3> :set paste!<CR>
```

### Custom Functions
```vim
" Custom function in .vimrc
function! ToggleBackground()
    if &background == 'dark'
        set background=light
    else
        set background=dark
    endif
endfunction

nnoremap <leader>bg :call ToggleBackground()<CR>
```

### Advanced Settings
```vim
" Performance optimizations
set lazyredraw          " Don't redraw during macros

" Buffer operations
:ls             " List buffers
:b filename     " Switch to buffer
:bd             " Delete buffer
:bn / :bp       " Next/previous buffer
```

### Quickfix and Location Lists
```vim
" Quickfix operations
:copen          " Open quickfix window
:cnext / :cprev " Navigate quickfix items
:cclose         " Close quickfix window

" Location list
:lopen          " Open location list
:lnext / :lprev " Navigate location items
```

## Advanced Search and Replace

### Regex Mastery
```vim
" Advanced patterns

```

### Multi-file Operations
```vim
" Search across files
:vimgrep /pattern/ **/*.py      " Search in Python files
:copen                          " Open results in quickfix

" Replace across files

```

## Integration with External Tools

### Compiler Integration
```vim
" Set compiler

" Terminal (Vim 8+/Neovim)
:terminal       " Open terminal
:!command       " Run external command
:r !command     " Read command output
```

## Performance Optimization

### Profiling Vim
```vim
" Profile startup
vim --startuptime startup.log

" Profile runtime

:profile func *
:profile file *
" [do operations]
:profile pause
:noautocmd qall!
```

### Optimization Techniques
```vim
" Lazy loading plugins
Plug 'plugin/name', { 'on': 'Command' }
Plug 'plugin/name', { 'for': 'filetype' }

" Disable unused features
let g:loaded_netrw = 1      " Disable netrw
let g:loaded_matchparen = 1 " Disable match paren
```

## Advanced Debugging

### Debugging Vim Configuration

:scriptnames           " List loaded scripts
```

### Plugin Debugging
```vim
" Disable plugins temporarily
